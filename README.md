# Clan event keywords
Alot of clans have regular events like Bingo events. These events require you to have some kind of keyword on-screen, so the admins that host the event, know the received items were received during the clan event period. 

People like me like to play without a chatbox, which results in having no option to have text inside the client. This plugin is a simple plugin that draws some text in a textbox (and the date if enabled) so you always have proof that you are not cheating in the event!
